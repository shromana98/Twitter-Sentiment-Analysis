# 🎯Objective: "Twitter Sentiment Analysis! 📊✨"

✨ **What is Sentiment Analysis?**

Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. 
It involves classifying the sentiment of text as positive, negative, or neutral.💭

⁉️ **Why is Sentiment Analysis Important?**

- Customer Feedback Analysis
- Brand Reputation Management
- Product Development and Innovation
- Competitor Analysis
- Marketing Campaign Effectiveness


**🎯 The Primary Aim of this project is to perform Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Texts Using NLP & Machine Learning Algorithms.**

### 🔍 Data :
 The sentiment140 dataset (Source: Kaggle).

### ✅ Text Processing and Visualization📊: 

-I started by preprocessing the raw Twitter data, including tasks such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming etc.
Then, I visualized the most frequent words using a word cloud, providing an intuitive overview of the data. 

### 📈 TF-IDF: 

- TF-IDF is an abbreviation for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency.
-  This is very common algorithm to transform text into a meaningful representation of numbers which is used to fit machine algorithm for prediction. 

### 🤖 Model Training:

- I trained a Logistic Regression model to predict sentiment based on the content. Got an Accuracy score of 78%.

### 💡 Model Evaluation:

- Achieved a ROC AUC score of approximately 0.86, indicating strong discrimination ability.
- Obtained an Average Precision Score (APS) of approximately 0.85, suggesting a high level of precision across all recall levels.

### 🔍 Predicting Sentiment

- Using the trained model, I predicted the sentiment of Twitter data as either positive or negative.
- This allowed for quick and automated analysis of large volumes of text data, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends.
